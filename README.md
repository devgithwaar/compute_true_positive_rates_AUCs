# Compute_true_positive_rates_AUCs


Transforming the confusion matrices to True/False Positive/Negative rates and the values of Area Under Receiver-Operating Curve  (AUROC)

Sometimes,  packages/libraries used do not return users with straightforward results of metric but just the indirect metric results, such as the confusion matrix.

In order to gain more straightforward views and more standardized metric results, such as the discovery rates of true positive, true negative, false positive, false negative and the values of Area Under Receiver-Operating Curve  (AUROC), confusion matrices are required to be further analyzed and proceeded so as to transform into more straightforward views.
